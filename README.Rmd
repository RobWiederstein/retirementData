# Introduction

The goal of the `retirementLoc` package was to consolidate some diverse and relevant factors on where to locate for retirement.  The data is located in the `retirementLoc` package but displayed on a separate dashboard [here](https://rob-wiederstein.shinyapps.io/retirement-dashboard/?_ga=2.138388592.1542637753.1630614255-2110524801.1630416115).  Criteria were included in the following order:

- the state name;
- the county name;
- a classification based on population density;
- population (estimate) in 2020;
- percent change of population since 2010;
- partisan lean or percent of population voting Democrat in the 2020 presidential race;
- life expectancy;
- average annual temperature;
- broadband penetration as of 2017;
- median value of owner occupied housing from 2009 adjusted for inflation and divided by average annual household income;
- rate of violent crimes;
- air quality and
- access to a primary care physician.

## Installation

You can install the development and experimental version of `retirementLoc` from its [repository](https://github.com/RobWiederstein/retirementLoc) with:

``` r
# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
install_github("RobWiederstein/retirementLoc")
```

## Load Data

Once the development package is installed, it can be loaded via:

```{r load-data}
library(retirementLoc)
```

## Common Questions

The data can provide some practical guidance as to candidate locations by identifying high growth counties, reasonable housing costs, air quality and life expectancy. For example, the code below might be used to answer where housing costs are reasonable:

```{r example}
retirementLoc |>
        dplyr::arrange(years_to_payoff) |>
        dplyr::select(state, county, pop_2020, years_to_payoff) |>
        dplyr::slice(1:5)
```

<!--You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.


# Displaying Code Blocks

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
